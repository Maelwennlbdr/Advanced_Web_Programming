                    Brittany is a small region in the North-West of France. Even if it’s not the most popular place
                    in France, it’s, for me, the most magical one. In this region you can find so many different
                    landscape. From beaches, to mountain, including farm and forest. In Brittany we can find small
                    traditional village, like Trébeurden or l’Île Grande, as well as bigger town, like Rennes or Brest. In
                    small village it’s really easy to find traditional house, with they iconic colorful, mostly blue,
                    shutters.<br>
                    I’m pretty sure my opinion isn’t the most neutral one, because I’m from Brittany. But for me
                    it’s the most beautiful place in France. More specifically one place near my home town. A small
                    lake surrounded by two island, and it’s so calm and amazing. If I’m ever stress about anything I
                    just go there and it calm me immediately. I think we can easily say that it’s my comfort place.<br>
